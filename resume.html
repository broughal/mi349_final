        <h2>Professional Work Experience</h2>
        <p>Since getting my first job at MC Sports in February of my junior year of high school, I've worked at over ten different jobs. These jobs have been of all different types, from working in a grocery market to a fast food store to a professional sports team filmer, I've got a lot of unique experiences under my belt, so I'll go over a few that aren't listed on the resume.</p>
        <p>Portrait Studio Photographer - I still work at this job, I just started this past October. Although currently on furlough because of covid, I learned a lot about myself during the month and I half I worked here. I worked Friday-Sunday and worked with the MSU football team Monday-Thursday. I was working 40+ hours each week with no days off while managing a full class load. It was a lot, and I'd never found myself this busy. I took it to be a learning experience to see how well I can handle being under a lot of stress and a lot going on, and I found that for that time period at least I managed everything pretty well.</p>
        <p>Little Caesers - I spent one of my summers a few years ago working at a Little Caesars near my house. I worked there with one of my good friends too. It was a lot of fun. I mainly worked at the bread stick station and would occasionally help out at the register. I </p>
        <p>Grocery Market - </p>
        <p>Amway Factory - I had this job a few summers ago and I only worked there for two weeks, but I learned a lot in that short time span. We would stand in position on an assembly line and do some sort of task for an hour before rotating to a new task. There were no windows, it was very loud, and there wasn't anyone to talk to. Working this job fulltime for two weeks had me feeling extremely depressed, I hated the lack of sunshine and I didn't enjoy the little human interaction. I quit and got another job right after.</p>
        <p>MC Sports - This was the first job I ever had. I was a sales associate in the footwear department and I absolutely loved it. I'm a big sneakerhead, so working with what seemed to be an endless wall of shoes was perfect for me. I knew a lot about shoes too so I was able to help customers with questions they had. This being the first job I ever had, I really learned how to show up to a place precisely on time and in uniform. I also played sports, so I learned how to balance a work, school, and sports schedule from an early point./p>
