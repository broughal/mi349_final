        <h2>MI 349</h2>            
        <p>Hello! My name is Alec Broughal and I'm a senior here at MSU majoring in Media & Information and double minoring in Information Technology and Spanish. If you're reading this then that means that you've stumbled across my MI 349 final project! Listed below are some of the different web design tools that I learned about while taking this course. On the following page you'll find information on my work experience.</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <div class="CSS"></div><p>CSS is a crucial part of HTML. Basically all the design work is done on that sheet. You can do things like include different types, classes, or IDs, change background and font colors, and resize articles/sections to fit your needs just to name a few.  </p>

            <h3>Section IDs</h3>
            <div class="sectionID"></div><p>Something that's pretty cool to web development is that in HTML you can name different articles or sections to be able to have custom sets of rules applied to them. That way you can have the same or different size fonts, padding, margins, etc. for various sections within one page of the site or on all. This technique is being used currently on this website to specify a consistent width between them all. </p>

            <h3>Pre-Production</h3>
            <div class="preProduction"></div><p>I learned about the importance of pre-production when it comes to designing and developing a website. Going through ahead of time and constructing a layout for each page will save time when it comes to writing the actual code for it. Having something to go off of is much easier than trying to code with no wireframes, comps, etc.</p>
