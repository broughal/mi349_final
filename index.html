        <h2>About Me</h2>            
        <p>Hello! My name is Alec Broughal and I'm a senior here at MSU majoring in Media & Information and double minoring in Information Technology and Spanish. If you're reading this then that means that you've stumbled across my MI 349 final project! Listed below are some of the different web design tools that I learned about while taking this course. on the following page you'll find information on my work experience.</p>

            <h3>Section IDs</h3>
            <div class="sectionID"></div><p>Something that's pretty cool to web development is that in HTML you can name different articles or sections to be able to have custom sets of rules applied to them. That way you can have the same or different size fonts, padding, margins, etc. for various sections within one page of the site or on all. This technique is being used currently on this website to specify a consistent width between them all. </p>
