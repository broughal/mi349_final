            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div class="intro"></div><p>Hello, my name is Alec Broughal. I'm a senior here at MSU majoring in Media & Information and double minoring in Information Technology and Spanish. My parents and sister live in Grand Rapids along with our dog Luna. A fun fact about me, when I was in 6th grade I made a YouTube account for Lego and Transformers videos, which eventually garnered enough views over time to land me a hefty paycheck of a few thousand dollars. I used that money to go towards paying my college tuition.</p>

            <h3>Current Jobs</h3>
            <div class="football"></div><p>I currently have two jobs, one is at a JCPenny portrait studio and the other one is as a filmer for the MSU football team. I've been filming the football team since my freshman year here when I got the job. It's been a blast these past few years and I'm blessed to have had the opportunity to have gotten to work alongside them. I more recently got the job at the portrait studio. I've been there for nearly a month. It's a fun job and my boss is phenomenal and amazing to work with which makes going there a lot nicer every time.</p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <div class="sparetime"></div><p>In my spare time I like to skateboard with my roommates. It's something we all picked up during our extended amount of down time that quarantine gave us. It's a fun way to pass the time with the homies and it's a thrill everytime you land a new trick. We've all improved tremendously since when we first started skating.</p>
